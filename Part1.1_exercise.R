#Calculate 1234 times 56



#Calculate logarithm of 100



#Create a numeric vector v1 which contains the numbers 1, 5, 0, 3, 8 and 300



#Create a numeric vector v2 which contains all numbers from 0 to 9



#Create a vector v3 which contains all even number from 1 to 20



#Create a vector v4 which contains the number 3, 5 times



#Create a numerical vector v5 which contains the words "mainanalytics" and "Sulzbach"



#create a vector v6 with some 0 and 1 (example: 0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1)
#Use v6 to generate a factor f1 with lables "yes" and "no" instead of 1 and 0
#Display the factor f1



#Use v1 to generate a matrix m1 with 3 rows and 2 columns. 
#Display m1



#Create a 3x3 matrix m2 with 1 in the diagonal and 0 in the other fields (use only nrow parameter and not ncol)



#Create a dataframe df1 with the columns "name", "age" and "sex" and the observations ('Eva', 31, 'f'), ('Peter', 42, 'm') and ('Hans', 17, 'm')



#Create a dataframe df2 out of the two vectors v2 and v3



#Create a list l1 which contains v1, m1, df1 and the string "hello"



#Display the first and the last element of v1



#Display second, third and fourth element of v2



#Display first row of m1



#Display second column of m2



#Display first observation of df1



#Display column age of df1 (use 3 different ways)



#Display 2nd element of the list l1



#2nd element of l1 is a matrix. Display 1st element of 2nd row of this matrix (->should be 5)



#Create a quest q1 which displayes if elements in v1 are less than 5

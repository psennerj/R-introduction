#read in dataset iris.csv



#check which elements of the variable "Petal.Width" are missing



#drop all observations which contain missing values



#calculate mean of iris$Petal.Length



#if the output of the function is NA, use the na.rm variable to avoid missing values within the calculation



#use the following code to create a list of matrices

l <- list(m1 = matrix(1:9, 3), 
          m2 = matrix(seq(1, 18, by = 2)))

#have a look at both matrices


#calculate the mean of both matrices by using a for loop (note: you have to initialize the otputvector)



#calculate the mean using lapply()
